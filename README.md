 2.Unzip the distribution archive to the directory you wish to install Maven. I extracted maven to my Documents folder.
 
 3.Add Maven to the PATH. More information can be found in the README.txt in the zip folder.
 
   Here's an example of how I added Maven to my PATH on MacOS. I added the folowing to the ~/.bash_profile.
   
     $ export PATH=/Users/admin/Documents/Software/apache-maven-3.5.0/bin:$PATH
     
   Then sourced (execute) the content of the ~/.bash_profile

 4.Verify Maven was correctly installed
 
   Command:
   
     $ mvn â€“version
     
Maven dependencies are crucial to running any Maven project.

Maven dependencies contains key references to libraries that a Maven project needs to execute. The pom.xml in the root of a Maven project file stores the dependencies for a project.
